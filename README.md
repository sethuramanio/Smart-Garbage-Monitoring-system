# Smart-Garbage-Monitoring-system

Manual garbage pickup and cleaning is a tedious, boring and repetitive task , and autonomous robot can be a potential candidate for this application. This can prevent workers from potential health hazards and also increase the efficiency of the task. 

This repository contains the complete end to end to framework for designing an autonomous garbage collection robot. This robot is has a 3 DOF robotic arm attached with it. This can communicate with other robots for performing efficient garbage collecton. 
For this we made of robots that can communicate with each other and take coordinated actions. 

This robot is controlled using a mobile application and the backend is hosted on AWS server. This robot is designed in such a way that it can follow a optimsed path from the start to destination using minimum spanning tree algorithm. This also has a sense of signal(wifi) range and connectivity strength. 


This repo has the complete front end and backend codes with roboti controls.
